# CSS WEB LAYOUT 
layout is very important and w would be looking at three different layout properties:

- flexbox
- grid
- box

## Flexbox property 
flexbox property adds responsiveness to css with float elements and positioning one dimensional refers to the fact that a given flex box container will arrange items in either a column or a row along its axis.
The flex box container applied over an element can flex to shrink or expand. Thus resulting in a flexible responsive design
```
#sample {
    display: flex;
}
```
## Griid property
CSS grid is similar to the flex box except it creates a two dimensional grid along both the row and column axes
