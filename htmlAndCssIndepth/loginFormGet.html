<!-- How does this form work if the method attrbute is set to get;

- When the login button is clicked the form data is sent as part of the request URL
- This means that the user details is appended at the end of the url in the web navigaton bar
- The web server recieves the http GET request, and extracts the form data from the URL.

This method has three key problems:
- The length of the URL is limited to around 2000 characters depending on the browser
- The length of the url is also limited on the web server. popular server such as apache allows up to around 4096 characters
- Security, data are stored on you browser history and possibly on the request log on the web server. -->
